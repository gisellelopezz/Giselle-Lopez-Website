        <p class="lead mb-4">I have taken part in many experiences that have helped shape the person I am now and the skills I can contribute to my success. Throughout my highschool experience I was able to take part of being part of a team, contributing in the establishment of a committee, volunteering in my elementary and my church as an assistant, and ultimately getting a job after graduation as a sales associate. All these different experiences each taught me different skills that I can bring into my next career path. I am the type of person who could lead a group of members effectively through communication, delegation, leadership, and responsibility skills I possess. When it comes to making a project or task come true I tend to see the big picture and try multiple ways to carry them out. Preferably I like to work with others to be able to get a greater outcome. However, working alone also lets me enhance my creativity and push myself harder to keep growing.<br><br>

        Since my freshman year of highschool, I have volunteered at my elementary school as a teaching assistant for my 6th grade teacher. This was one of the first experiences I encountered during my highschool career. With this I gained many new skills such as leadership, communication, and working with children. This position consisted of the interaction with 5th and 6th grade students. There I would help them with assignments, projects, and tutor in subjects such as math and english. However, at the beginning the position seemed much simpler. I would help by doing basic activities such as filing and grading papers. As I got more experienced I began to take on different tasks as well such as preparing for in class activities and interacting with the students. For four years I volunteered twice a week except for winter, spring, and occasionally summer breaks. This position allowed me to explore the field of becoming a teacher and gain experience that then helped me when participating in school programs such as becoming part of a team and being one of the founders of a committee.<br><br>

        Another experience that has greatly influenced my today was being co-captain of my Short Flags team. At the beginning of highschool, I was a very shy girl who was afraid to get out of her comfort zone. I wouldnâ€™t take part in any clubs or after school activities. However, towards the end of sophomore year I decided to try out for a team, Short Flags. This team, similar to cheerleading, consists of a group who performs at football games and pep rallies using a pair of flags. Being part of this team taught me many skills that I didn't have yet and enforced those I did. This team takes a lot of dedication. Towards my senior year, I was named co-captain. Although a bit challenging, this gave me the opportunity to learn how to improve my leadership skills having to be in charge of practices and performances. Overall, I was able to develop essential skills that in the future will help me be a great leader.
